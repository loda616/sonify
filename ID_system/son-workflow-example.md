# SON ID System Implementation Workflow

## Setup and Integration Guide

This document outlines the practical implementation of the SON ID system within your project management workflow, with specific examples tailored to the Sonify app development.

## Initial Setup

### 1. Create ID Registry

Create a central registry file `son_id_registry.md` to track all assigned IDs:

```markdown
# SON ID Registry

## User Interface (UI)
- SON-T1-UI001: Implement dark mode toggle with animation
- SON-F3-UI002: Add custom font selection in settings
- SON-I2-UI003: Fix layout issues on smaller screens

## Text-to-Speech (TS)
- SON-B1-TS001: Fix crash when processing special characters
- SON-F2-TS002: Implement additional voice options
- SON-E3-TS003: Optimize speech generation speed
```

### 2. Define Area Codes

Document all area codes in `son_area_codes.md`:

```markdown
# SON Area Codes

- UI: User Interface components and visual elements
- TS: Text-to-Speech functionality and voice processing
- AP: Audio Player features and controls
- ST: Storage management and file handling
- TH: Theming and appearance customization
- BE: Backend services and API integration
- DB: Database structure and data management
- SY: System-wide or cross-component functionality
```

## Workflow Integration

### Task Creation Workflow

1. **Identification**: When a new task, issue, or feature is identified:
   - Determine the type (Task, Issue, Bug, Feature, Enhancement)
   - Assign a priority level (1-5)
   - Identify the relevant area of the system
   - Check the registry for the next available number in that area

2. **Registration**: Add the new item to the registry with a descriptive title

3. **Assignment**: Create the task in your issue tracker with the SON ID as the prefix

### Development Workflow

1. **Branch Naming**: Create feature branches using the SON ID:
   ```
   git checkout -b SON-B1-TS001-fix-special-chars
   ```

2. **Commit Messages**: Begin all commit messages with the SON ID:
   ```
   git commit -m "SON-B1-TS001: Fixed handling of Unicode characters in TTS engine"
   ```

3. **Pull Requests**: Include the SON ID in PR titles:
   ```
   SON-B1-TS001: Fix TTS crash on special characters
   ```

4. **Code Comments**: Reference the SON ID in relevant code comments:
   ```dart
   // SON-B1-TS001: Special character handling
   String sanitizeInput(String text) {
     // Implementation
   }
   ```

### Tracking and Reporting

Create a simple dashboard to track status by type, priority, and area:

```markdown
# SON Status Dashboard - March 19, 2025

## By Priority
- Critical (1): 3 items (2 open, 1 resolved)
- High (2): 5 items (3 open, 2 resolved)
- Medium (3): 8 items (4 open, 4 resolved)
- Low (4): 6 items (2 open, 4 resolved)

## By Type
- Tasks (T): 7 items
- Bugs (B): 6 items
- Features (F): 5 items
- Enhancements (E): 4 items

## By Area
- UI: 6 items
- TS: 5 items
- AP: 4 items
- ST: 3 items
- BE: 2 items
```

## Practical Examples for Sonify App

### Example 1: Text-to-Speech Bug

**Identification**: There's a critical bug where the app crashes when trying to generate speech from text containing emoji.

**SON ID Assignment**: `SON-B1-TS004` (Bug, Critical, Text-to-Speech, 4th item)

**Task Description**:
```
Title: SON-B1-TS004: App crashes when processing text with emoji

Description:
When a user enters text containing emoji characters and attempts to generate 
speech, the app crashes immediately. This occurs in the TTSService when calling
the generateSpeech method.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Enter text with emoji (e.g., "Hello ðŸ˜Š")
2. Press the Generate Speech button
3. Observe app crash

Affected files:
- tts_service.dart (generateSpeech method)

Assigned to: [Developer name]
```

**Commit Message**:
```
SON-B1-TS004: Fixed emoji handling in TTS engine

- Added character filtering in the sanitizeInput method
- Unit tests for emoji character handling
- Exception handling in generateSpeech method
```

### Example 2: UI Enhancement

**Identification**: A medium-priority enhancement to improve the audio player widget UI.

**SON ID Assignment**: `SON-E3-AP005` (Enhancement, Medium priority, Audio Player, 5th item)

**Task Description**:
```
Title: SON-E3-AP005: Enhance audio player UI with waveform visualization

Description:
Add a waveform visualization to the audio player to provide visual feedback
during playback. This should work in both light and dark modes and update
in real-time as the audio plays.

Requirements:
- Responsive waveform display that works with all audio lengths
- Color-coded visualization that adapts to the current theme
- Progress indicator showing current position in the waveform

Affected files:
- audio_player_widget.dart

Assigned to: [UI Developer name]
```

**Commit Message**:
```
SON-E3-AP005: Added waveform visualization to audio player

- Implemented AudioWaveform widget
- Connected visualization to playback position
- Added theme-aware styling
- Optimized rendering for performance
```
